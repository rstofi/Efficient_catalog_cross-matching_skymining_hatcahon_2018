### Efficient catalogue cross-matching – Paul Hancock (Curtin University)

Variations in the brightness of objects in the sky over time can be the result of a range of exciting astronomical phenomena – from exploding stars to black holes. Identification of these events from their light curves means that we need to first form these light curves by joining many catalogues.

This joining, or cross-matching, process presents a number of challenges – uncertainties in position, source confusion, missing data, and weird shaped sources. We currently have a few methods that work OK when the catalogues are very well behaved, but which are either very slow, or make many errors.

__Creating an effective, efficient, and scalable solution would greatly assist in the ongoing research into these objects.__ An ideal solution would be something that could run within a database and be updated as new catalogues are added, but even a stand-alone script would be of great benefit.
